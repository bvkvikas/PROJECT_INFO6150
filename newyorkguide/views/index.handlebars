      <h1>New York Guide</h1>
      <p>Ask any local on the New York and they’ll probably tell you, they came to New York for the skiing and stayed for the summers. There is no place quite like New York in the summer. You can find a lifetime’s worth of outdoor activities to do. Kids float through town on inner tubes, while cyclists and hikers head off in every direction. People wander the galleries and shops, or park themselves on the benches along Main Street and watch the bustle of daily activity flow by. And above it all, incredible azure skies inspire you to breathe life in full. It’s a good reason the days are long because that’s the only way to fit everything in.

      <h1>WHEN TO VISIT</h1>
      <p>NYC is a year-round destination, with iconic events like U.S. Open tennis (Aug–Sep) and Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade (Nov). Spring and fall have mild weather and strong performing-arts seasons. In summer, there are free, outdoor cultural events. On summer weekends, many New Yorkers leave town, making it a good time to score reservations at popular restaurants. Dec brings the Rockefeller Center tree lighting (varies, Nov/Dec) and Times Square's New Year's Eve party (Dec 31). Jan–Mar is cold, with an easier chance of getting Broadway tickets.</p>
